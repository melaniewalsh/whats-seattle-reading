    "text": "A Note on Sensitive Information\nAll of the information in this dataset is publicly available. Nevertheless, information about any individual writer’s year of birth, gender identity, race, ethnicity, or education is sensitive. This data is provided here only to enable the study of broad patterns throughout the history of the NEA Creative Writing Fellowships and not intended as definitive. Requests to correct, amend, or remove any such sensitive information will be honored. Please contact Alexander Manshel (alexander.manshel@mcgill.ca) with any questions or concerns.\nMore than 240 NEA fellowships have been awarded to writers who have publicly identified themselves as “white” or “a white writer,” and are listed here as such. That said, nearly 2900 fellowships (over 78 percent of all fellowships in the dataset) are listed as “uniden,” or unidentifying, in the field corresponding to race and ethnicity. Many of these writers likely identified or identify as white, but the research team was nevertheless unable to find a source to corroborate that active identification. This is unsurprising given how whiteness often goes unmarked. As Morrison (1993) writes in Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination about one of Ernest Hemingway’s characters, “we know [he] is white, and we know he is because nobody says so.” Despite this, writers in this dataset are listed alternatively as “white” or “uniden” in order to avoid presuming or projecting whiteness onto individual writers. Given that many writers refer to themselves as “Irish American” or “German American,” for example, without explicitly identifying as white, the dataset lists them here as “uniden / irisham” or “uniden / germanam.”\nThe 94 unique values for the field of “race_ethnicity” include: “afam” (African American); “arabam” (Arab American); “asianam” (Asian American); “black / caribam” (Black or Caribbean American); “indigenous,” “latinx,” “mixedrace,” “uniden,” “uniden / jewish,” “white,” “white / jewish.” In the case that writers identify in multiple ways, those multiple identifications are listed here separated by slashes: e.g., “asianam / southasian,” “indigenous / latinx,” “uniden / germanam / jewish.”"

    "text": "In summer of 2021, the Post45 Data Collective awarded its inaugural round of Data Development Grants. These grants were designed to help researchers in the late stages of data collection — where projects have a tendency to stall — complete their data curation and cleaning, and prepare their data for publication with the Data Collective.\nWe were fortunate to have an excellent partner supporting these efforts. In collaboration with the University of Chicago’s Graduate Global Impact Program, we worked with Jordan Pruett, a doctoral candidate in English, to provide DDP Grant Recipients with up to 60 hours of research assistance each. Jordan offered his expertise as a student of computational text analysis and post-45 American literature, providing considerable support and insight.\nIn sum, we supported the work of four excellent projects addressing a range of subjects, from the Literature Program of the NEA to a corpus of Film Scripts. Together, these projects represent the exciting possibilities for computational approaches to post-45 US literature and culture.\n—\nThe Wars in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan in US Fiction, 1965-2020\nDavid F. Eisler\nThis dataset collects titles of American novels and short story collections published between 1965 and 2020 about the conflicts in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan, bringing together multiple bibliographic resources to build a comprehensive picture of more than half a century of the US war fiction genre. We began by merging and cleaning two established sources on the works about the Vietnam War, John Newman’s Vietnam War Literature: An Annotated Bibliography of Imaginative Works about Americans Fighting in Vietnam and La Salle University’s special archival collection, “Imaginative Representations of the Vietnam War.” We then used the WorldCat database to extract a set of imaginative works about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were combined with the Vietnam data to form the final dataset. We will complete the dataset by adding ethnographic data about the author’s gender and whether they were a military veteran.\nNew York Times Nonfiction Bestsellers by Black Authors\nAriel Lawrence\nTo examine the prevalence, profitability, and popularity of nonfiction texts written by Black authors, we collected weekly bestseller lists published by the New York Times from 2010 to 2020. We researched each author and located those who either self-identified as Black or of African descent or were identified by reputable sources as such. Out of 1657 titles, we located 117 identified as by at least one Black author, a rate of about 7%. In addition to title and author, this dataset includes categories for genre (essays, celebrity or general memoir, anti racist pedagogy, manifesto, social analysis, etc.), author occupation, publisher, year published, book description, top rank, and number of weeks each book remained on the list. With this dataset, we aim to better understand the past and future of Black nonfiction.\nThe Black List Film Script Corpus\nJohnny Ma\nThe Black List Film Script Corpus (TBL Corpus) is a collection of ~1,000 movie scripts that were featured on The Black List. Founded in 2006, The Black List is an annual collection of promising screenplays compiled from the votes of hundreds of film executives. Our TBL Corpus contains nearly all TBL scripts in .txt format, with line indenting parsed from the original PDF submission. We include author and script metadata where available.\nThis corpus builds upon other screenplay corpora, such as ScriptBase, that aim to understand the creative output of screenwriters. The TBL Corpus differs from previous such datasets as it contains unproduced screenplays, giving us an exclusive look into screenplays at the pre-greenlight stage of film production. The corpus also comes from scripts written in 2006-2020, making it the most current dataset of movie scripts available. We plan to update the dataset with each annual iteration of The Black List. \nThe Literature Program of the National Endowment for the Arts\nAlexander Manshel\nThis project will create a comprehensive database of the writers funded by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), under the auspices of the NEA’s literature fellowship program. Since its inception in 1965, the NEA has funded more than 3600 poets and fiction writers. Over that half century, the Endowment’s selection process and funding priorities have shifted repeatedly in response to government oversight, the composition of its advisory boards, and evolving notions of literary prestige. This database will allow scholars and students to investigate how these changes have influenced which writers are sponsored by the NEA. In its first iteration, the database will include essential information about each writer, including year of funding, demographic data, and information on their undergraduate and graduate education. As the project develops, it may also include information about the specific literary works funded by NEA grants. In all, this project aims to provide a useful resource for scholars of twentieth- and twenty-first-century American literature, multi-ethnic American literature, and literary sociology."

    "text": "The Post45 Data Collective is a peer-reviewed, open-access repository for literary and cultural data from 1945 to the present.\nPeer Review & Citation\nWe encourage scholars to share their data openly by providing a formal peer review process for datasets and by publishing datasets with citable DOIs that are registered with the Library of Congress. These conventions enable scholars to earn much-deserved recognition for their intellectual labor, since peer-reviewed publications and citations are considered among the highest forms of scholarly achievement.\nExploration & Usability\nWe further enable the scholarly community and general public to explore and re-use our datasets by hosting them on an easily navigable website that allows for simple searching, filtering, and downloading.\nDocumentation & Data Essays\nLastly, we provide robust documentation for all our datasets by requiring authors to submit “data essays,” which address the social and historical context of the data, how the data was collected, cleaned, and categorized, as well as possible ethical concerns or misuses of the data.\n\nSupport\nThe Post45 Data Collective is supported by Emory’s Center for Digital Scholarship. We have also received support from the National Endowment for the Humanities (2024-2026) and, in 2023, from Emory’s Program to Enhance Research and Scholarship (PERS).\n\n\nHistory of the Project\nDan Sinykin and Laura B. McGrath began planning and research for the Post45 Data Collective in 2019. They observed that many scholars in the field of post-1945 literature and culture were building datasets and collaborating informally to figure out how to make various interpretive and technical decisions related to the data. Data is particularly important to the period of literary and cultural history after 1945 because of the exponential growth in the number of books and cultural objects produced, which makes understanding broad trends in the field difficult without the help of data.\nWhile the scholar-driven curation of datasets in the 2010s was thus very valuable, scholars’ formatting and documentation choices were happening on a piecemeal basis; they were not receiving academic recognition for their labor; and their finished datasets did not have a suitable home.\nTo address these problems, Sinykin and McGrath decided to launch a field-specific, open-access, peer-reviewed data collective. To do so, they performed a literature review, assembled an editorial board (consisting of scholars in literary studies, digital humanities, and library and information science), developed peer review criteria, and established coordination with the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship, which agreed to build a website and maintain its data infrastructure. On March 1, 2021, Sinykin and McGrath launched the Post45 Data Collective.\nIn the summer of 2021, we launched the “Data Development Project” (DDP), a program designed to help researchers in the field complete the final stages of data collection work by providing them with up to 60 hours of data curation-focused research assistance. Through this assistance (awarded via mini-grants), we supported the work of four excellent datasets, which address subjects ranging from the literature program of the NEA to Hollywood film screenplays, and which will eventually be published in the collective.\n\n\nPublic Writing & Media\nIn October 2022 and November 2023, the Post45 Data Collective partnered with Public Books to publish two series of essays, “Hacking the Culture Industries,” which both drew on and were inspired by data from the collection.\nPost45 Data Collective datasets have also been featured prominently in venues including the Los Angeles Review of Books, Poets & Writers Magazine, and WNYC’s On the Media."

    "text": "Collection and Creation\nThe data about prizes and winner/judge demographics was collected by hand mainly from institutional websites. Gender and higher education data for individuals was collected from author biographies, interviews, and other materials.  Some information about judges not listed on websites was obtained through correspondence with institutions. Claire Grossman, Juliana Spahr, and Stephanie Young are the principal investigators, did the majority of the data gathering, and are responsible for any errors. They were assisted by Jennifer Chukwu, Clare Lilliston, Jordan Pruett, Esther Vinarov, and Betty He. Richard Jean So provided significant support for this project.\nGender information was provisionally labeled by the research team based on pronouns used by author in biographical notes at the time research was completed. It is possible a judge/winner’s gender identity and/or pronoun may have changed subsequently. This information is intended to enable study of broad patterns over time and not as definitive statements on any individual identity.

    "text": "Collection and Creation\nThis data was assembled by Jordan Pruett. Matches between prize-winning authors and authors in the HathiTrust Digital Library were produced by performing an exact string comparison between the last_name and given_name columns of the prize dataset to the author column of the HathiTrust dataset held by the Post45 Data Collective. Fields were forced to lowercase and stripped of punctuation and spacing before comparison. This conservative matching process is likely to produce two kinds of errors: missed matches, in the case of authors who appear under different names in the two spreadsheets; and false positive matches, in the rare case of two authors with identical first and last names. The first type of error was considered acceptable: the data aims to maximize true positive matches rather than minimize false negatives. Since matches were assessed restrictively, researchers can be confident that the vast majority of the entries in this dataset were in fact authored by somebody who also appears in the prize dataset. In order to estimate the rate of the second, more problematic type of error, a random sample of 100 entries was taken from the final dataset and checked manually for accuracy. This sample contained no errors, though it did contain one match that could not be verified, since no secondary literature could be located for the author in question.\nFinally, it is worth noting that hathitrust_prizewinners.csv does not distinguish between the types of prizes won by authors nor the point in their careers that those authors won those prizes. For each author in the prize dataset, it simply lists every HathiTrust volume authored by that author that could be located.\nAt a later stage, persistent identifiers for authors, such as VIAF, LCCN, and Wikidata identifiers, were added by Matt Miller computationally. He also added book information from OCLC—a global library organization that contains information from more than 16,000 member libraries in more than 100 countries—such as how many copies of each edition are held by these libraries (oclc_holdings or oclc_eholdings). This information was accessed through the OCLC Classify API, which was shut down in January 2024."

    "text": "Significance and Context\nThese datasets provide valuable metadata for researchers of 20th century American literature working in fields such as cultural analytics, book and publishing history, and the sociology of literature. In cultural analytics, recent scholarship has used bestseller status as a rough proxy for popularity, enabling researchers to computationally model the textual boundaries between, for instance, popular and prizewinning fiction (Algee-Hewitt and McGurl 2015; Piper et al. 2016b; English 2016). Previous research of this kind has often relied on the Publishers Weekly annual bestseller list. Although Publishers Weekly also publishes a weekly list, it is not readily accessible to researchers. In contrast to the Publishers Weekly annual list, this dataset reports weekly bestsellers, and therefore captures a much broader subset of the historical literary marketplace.\nThis larger and more granular New York Times dataset presents researchers with a number of potential uses. First of all, existing experiments on bestsellers and prizewinners could be reproduced with this new data. The broader scope of this dataset is likely to dampen the apparent difference between prizewinners and bestsellers, as many prizewinners made it onto the Times list without making it onto that of Publisher’s Weekly. Second, the broader scope of the Times list provides a valuable resource for constructing corpora of historical popular literature. Weekly bestsellers have been neglected in humanities corpora relative to yearly bestsellers. Finally, the Times list could be used to support ongoing research at the intersection of literary and publishing history. As the most closely-followed public-facing bestseller list, the Times list offers insight into the works considered valuable by publishers."

    "text": "Significance & Context\nFeminist Bookstore News (FBN), a US-based publication, was the publisher of record for the “women in print” movement. A hand-printed, stapled-in-the-corner newsletter, FBN grew to be the preeminent book trade magazine for feminist bookstores including feminist and lesbian publishers, vendors selling to feminist bookstores, and interested feminist readers. In addition, a range of mainstream and specialty bookstores as well as corporate, independent press, and other social movement publishers read FBN avidly. Carol Seajay operated FBN from 1976 until 2000, publishing 134 issues. These issues ranged from eight pages to over 150 pages per issue. At the end of the run of the periodical, two issues were fully electronic, 22.5 and 23.1.\nThe “Descriptive Database of Articles in Feminist Bookstore News 1976-2000” is a descriptive bibliography of articles in FBN for researchers to search and explore the thousands of articles published and the wide range of material considered in the magazine. A second enumerative bibliography is planned with every book mentioned in Feminist Bookstore News during its lifespan; this second dataset is anticipated in 2025. Together, these datasets respond to Kate Ozment’s call for feminist book history that “knits a narrative of book history through librarianship, book collecting, and textual editing alongside the traditional space of bibliography.”\n\nBackground & Scholarship\nPrinting and publishing were crucial elements of women’s and gay liberation. In the case of women’s liberation, independent newspapers, magazines, journals, printing press operations, and publishing houses were so significant that women involved in these activities came to call themselves the “women in print movement,” organizing conferences and other activities to support their work. This explosion of printing and publishing work from 1969 through 2000 by feminists, with lesbian-feminists playing important leadership roles in the movement, resulted in a wide range of books, periodicals, and other printed material available for study.\nPrint culture is thus a vibrant node to explore women’s liberation and gay and lesbian liberation. For example, Martin Meeker highlights how print and publishing helped gay men and lesbians find one another. Since Trysh Travis’s “The Women in Print Movement” and its “analysis of how gender and power shaped ‘the little world of the book,’” multiple scholars have explicated feminist book history. Jaime Harker situates its southern roots; Kristen Hogan maps feminist bookstores as an important site of antiracist thinking and activism in feminist and lesbian communities, while Junko R. Onosaka considers the roles these bookstores played in making the stories of women’s lives and experiences more visible and available to readers. Kathy Liddle develops the concept of “cultural interaction spaces” to describe feminist bookstores as spaces where women developed “identities as feminists and/or lesbians.” I have written extensively about independent publishers in the movement and, more recently, about the significance of bibliography for figures like Barbara Grier and the transnational movements of texts through networks in the movement.\nStill other scholars use the print material from the movement to elaborate further the issues and concerns of lesbians. Cait McKinney, for example, explores the “circle of lesbian indexers” who stepped up to make “critical choices about the tools” used and “the classifications schemes they assigned to ‘lesbian experience.’” June Thomas’s new book A Place Of Our Own provides a personal account of the impact of the women in print movement and lesbian-feminist activism during the era. These works complement recent engagements by Richard Jean So examining the race of authors in post-World War II fiction and by Dan Sinykin in documenting the impact of corporate conglomerates on American fiction — so, in particular, advocates for the significance of large datasets and their potential for humanities research with social justice outcomes.\nWhile all these attentions are vital, assessments of the scope and impact of the women in print movement have not been fully explored. As these organizations recede into memory, describing, quantifying, and analyzing the work of the women in print movement becomes more important for the historical record. \n\n\nHow Researchers Might Use This Dataset\nFBN is a rich archive for research about publishing, the women in print movement, and more. This database offers a way for researchers to find and locate materials more efficiently among the over 10,000 pages published by FBN.\nThis data has already proven generative at the journal Sinister Wisdom in the hands of volunteers, interns, and people interested in lesbian literature and histories.\nResearchers might examine this data to explore questions like:\n\nWhat was the economic and cultural scope of feminist bookstores during the 1980s and 1990s?\n\nWhat were key contributions of social change publishing in the independent publishing scene between 1976 and 2000?\n\nHow did feminist bookstores spark a network of feminist merchants who built small, sustainable businesses around bookstores and other feminist cultural events such as music festivals?\n\nWhat effects did desktop publishing have on independent publishing? What were crucial moments of desktop publishing’s entry into independent publishing?\n\nHow did other technologies (internet, web, mobile phones, etc.) effect independent publishing?\n\nHow did the visual language of feminism evolve during this period of increased computerization?\n\nHow did mainstream publishing respond to the feminist publishing movement?\n\nWhat conditions facilitated publishing gay and lesbian literary work in commercial publishing?\n\nWhat cultural, governmental, and/or political conditions influenced publishing during these decades? How did publishing influence cultural, governmental, and/or political conditions?\n\nThere is not another dataset that documents the range and diversity of activities of the women in print movement. The “Descriptive Database of Articles in Feminist Bookstore News (1976-2000)” offers a way to engage the histories of the women in print movement more robustly by making the over 10,000 pages of content easier to search, providing a view of the types of articles published that is easier to understand, and offering initial searchability for keywords to explore content further in the full corpus."

    "text": "Collection and Creation\nThe “Descriptive Database of Articles in Feminist Bookstore News (1976-2000)” was hand-compiled and collated from digital copies of FBN. Reveal Digital digitized issues of FBN from volume seven through twenty-two, part of the feminist component of the Independent Voices project. These issues now are available freely through JSTOR.\nThe digital collection of FBN, however, was incomplete. Before compiling this data, volunteers at Sinister Wisdom created a complete digital collection of FBN by scanning issues and ephemera through the San Francisco Public Library. All issues of FBN are now digitized and freely available at the Lesbian Poetry Archives. FBN also published and distributed nationally five, full-color, glossy Feminist Bookstores’ Catalogs. Digital copies of these catalogs are available at the Lesbian Poetry Archive. Additional ephemera—inserts to the newsletters, flyers, and other material—have been digitized and labeled as “extras.” During the 2000s, Carol Seajay initiated and edited Books To Watch Out For. More information and archives of those issues are available here: http://www.lesbianpoetryarchive.org/BTWOF. Books To Watch Out For is not included in this bibliographic project.\nWork on this dataset began with a brief note in a Sinister Wisdom email announcing our spring 2023 issue on its publication date, April 15, 2023. A postscript to the email said:\n\nPsst! Julie and Sinister Wisdom are cooking up a new project and need some helping hands. Have a bit of time from May until August? A solid internet connection? Like feminist and lesbian books? Like organizing information? We have a project for you!\nEmail Julie for more information and to express your interest. We will build a cohort of volunteers for a nifty project over the summer. Keep your eyes peeled for a zoom launch meeting and get on the special email list for more information.\n\nOver forty volunteers from Sinister Wisdom signed up to participate in the project. Chloe Berger, a graduate student in Spanish language and literature at the University of California-Berkeley, scanned the missing issues of FBN–and more—at the San Francisco Public Library (SFPL) and in consultation with Carol Seajay and her private collection.\nBy May 19th, the Sinister Wisdom Snapshot, our bi-weekly email of links, good reads, and lesbian/queer women’s happenings, posted this announcement:\n\nSinister Wisdom’s summer project working on an archive of Feminist Bookstore News is underway! If you have time this summer to volunteer on some database projects associated with it, please email Julie and mark your calendar for our kickoff meeting on Friday, 26 May 2023 at high noon ET. If you sign up for the project, you will receive a zoom link to the gathering.\n\nVolunteers flocked to the project with great energy and enthusiasm. In total, close to fifty volunteers participated in the project; thirty-eight volunteers keyed data from specific issues.\nWith a complete set of FBN scans, volunteers embarked on the work of creating a database of all the articles in FBN. A shared spreadsheet on Google Sheets offered a collaborative space to enter data. Initially, the spreadsheet contained columns for basic bibliographic data for each article in FBN plus a column for notes that volunteers could enter about the articles. As the project developed, more standard categories for each article emerged and that column was added.\nIndividual volunteers signed up for a specific issue of FBN, read it, and entered bibliographic information into the shared spreadsheet. Sinister Wisdom organized a series of Zoom meetings to explain the project and the process and then hosted Zoom work sessions during the summer of 2023.\nBy August 31, 2023, volunteers and interns completed data entry on sixty issues of FBN, about half the corpus. During the fall of 2023, we paused to assess the strengths and limitations of the existing data structure and refine it before completing the second half of the data entry for the descriptive bibliography of FBN in the spring. From December 2023 through March 2024, Sinister Wisdom volunteers and interns returned to the project and completed the database.\nVolunteers entered nearly all the data freeform. The primary reason for this freeform entry was that, while we tested the data entry on a smaller scale before opening to a broad community of volunteers even after that test, the team was unclear about what parameters to use to limit the data entry before final clean up. In addition, the team wanted to encourage volunteers to engage both with the individual issues of FBN and with the broader project through data entry that was open and invited each volunteer to engage and capture articles in ways that s/he determined. Ultimately, collectively the project team and the volunteers developed guidelines for some standardization in data entry, but the final database reflects differences among humans in reading, analysis, and entry.\nWhen the database was completed, Salome “Sam” Grasland cleaned and standardized the data for final use and display. A few initial fields were removed because they lacked data (for example, initially the spreadsheet contained a column for ad size, but that data was not completed consistently). Sam cleaned the author name field, which sometimes had misspellings. If additional information was known about the author, but not their name, then that information was put into brackets []. The spelling of all months was standardized and issues which previously had a slashed month, for example September/October, only the first month listed was retained. Issue numbers were standardized to always be 9.10, for example for combined issues. Sam cleaned the category field and grouped like categories together. The graphics column was changed to yes/no. Spellcheck was also run on the overall data and many errors in spelling were corrected. However, throughout the data, capitalization is capacious and, given that the project team included people both in the United States and the United Kingdom, there is not a standardization of English.\nIn addition to the “Descriptive Database of Articles in Feminist Bookstore News (1976-2000),” Cassidy Hunt, a volunteer, generated a list of every issue published, with notes about numbering oddities and other bibliographic details. This list is included as an addition to the dataset in three formats: PDF, Word, and Excel files.\nSalome “Sam” Grasland and her co-worker Nayeli Jaime at The Information Lab created a dashboard for the project. The dashboard searches the “Descriptive Database of Articles in Feminist Bookstore News (1976-2000)” and presents results next to renderings of the PDF issue in which the articles appear. The dashboard is hosted on Tableau Public and offers a searchable interface for the “Descriptive Database.” The dashboard is available here.\nThe labor to compile the “Descriptive Database” was done completely by queer volunteers at Sinister Wisdom. Many people working on the project recognize FBN and the communities that it networked as vital to lesbian history and heritage. I (Julie) believe that labor undertaken to preserve and analyze lesbian history should be compensated, and I also recognize that compensation is often not possible under the current conditions of capitalism in which we live."

    "text": "Description\nThe “Descriptive Database of Articles in Feminist Bookstores News (1976-2000)” is a flat-file with each row describing one article in an issue of FBN. There are over 5,900 rows of data. There are fourteen columns in the dataset.\nThe columns are:\n\nvol: FBN volume number (Sequentially numbered 1-23.)\n\nno: FBN issue number (For most issues, these are numerals; combined issues, for instance the combined release of numbers 9 and 10, are represented as 9.10 in the dataset. There are seven occurrences of SP as an issue number, sp for special or supplemental issues. Volume 6 contains one SP which was a special insert into 6.2 that was mailed only to bookstores and not other subscribers. Beginning with volume 13 and extending through volume 18, SP issues are issues focused on sidelines. There are additional sidelines issues after volume 18, but they are numbered numerically and not with SP.)\nvolume.no: FBN volume and issue number combined (represented as x.y and useful for sorting)\n\ntotal_pages: Number of pages in the issue that contain article content (pages in the archived .pdf. Pagination varies within the issues across the publication.)\n\nyear: Year the issue was published\n\nmonth: Month the issue was published (Early issues are not dated as clearly as later issues. For some early issues, this column surmises the month, often from a mail cancellation.)\n\narticle_title: Article title (There is great variability among titles, subtitles, and title conventions over the lifetime of the periodical. There is no imposed standardization on this field.)\n\npage_start: the page number on which the item first appears\n\npage_end: the page number on which the item last appears. (Beginning in the early 1980s, FBN used a cardstock cover. These covers (front cover, inside front, inside back, and back cover) are unpaginated. The dataset uses c1, c2, c3, and c4 respectively in this field and the previous one to indicate these pages.)\n\nauthor: Author of the article (when attributed. Carol Seajay is the presumptive author of many unattributed articles. There is inconsistency in the file of the application of her name to the author category, for instance, some records indicate unknown [Seajay] and others indicate unknown [FBN]; all may have been written by Carol Seajay. In some records, a presumptive author is indicated in brackets after unknown.)\n\ncategory: See below for more information on descriptions of each category.\n\ngraphics? Yes/No if graphics were present in the article\n\nnotes: This column is broad and capacious. Volunteers used it to summarize the article, write down the different subheadings in an article, point out interesting things in the article, or explain what graphics appear in this article.\n\nvolunteer: Volunteer Name (A complete list of all volunteers who compiled data for the dataset is included at the end of this essay.)\n\nunique_id: This column was appended in the final creation of the file for citation purposes.\n\nA database necessarily imposes a structure onto materials that evolved over twenty-four years. In compiling the database, the team tried to capture the material in ways that respect the expressions and evolutions of the periodical. In collectively compiling the data, the volunteer team erred more on the side of expression than standardization.\nThe question of how to categorize articles was a subject of discussion among the research team. These notes were written initially by volunteer Li-Anne Wright.\nWhat each category means:\n\nBooklist/Medialist\n\nA list of books on a theme. These may have a few paragraphs of preamble but mostly focus on giving a list of books.\n\nExamples: Women’s Alcohol and Drug Abuse Booklist, Bestsellers Lists, Kids’ Lit\n\n\nExternal Booklists and Awards\n\nThis category captures external lists such as the Lambda Awards. It differs from the previous category, “Booklist/Media list” in that the lists for this category are determined by institutions other than Feminist Bookstore News.\n\n\nAdvertisements\n\nThese could include calls for submissions, posters, blurbs publicizing future events, advertisements for books, etc.\n\n\nLetters\n\nLetters written to FBN\n\nIn each FBN issue there is a section for letters. Make one row for all of the letters and index them together in that one row.\n\n\nNews Feature\n\nThese articles are longer (1.5+ full pages) and news (informative about some happening)\n\n\nShort News\n\nIf the article fits a more specific category below, use the more specific category. Otherwise, you can just put “Short News.” More specific categories include:\n\nShort News Publishers\n\nNews from publishers\n\n\nShort News Bookstores\n\nNews from bookstores\n\n\n\nThese articles are shorter (a few paragraphs to a page) and news (informative about some happening)\n\nCan use this category to refer to a collection of short news (like the “Back to Press and Other Good News” column)\n\n\nEditor’s Note\n\nEach issue opens with a letter from the editor. It might be called “From the Computer Desk” or something similar.\n\n\nWorkshop Summary\n\nArticles of any length that summarize the findings from a conference or workshop.\n\n\nThey Went That-A-Way\n\nA regular column that appears in every newsletter\n\n\nPresslist\n\nUsed to refer to the lists of recently published books, such as “From the University Presses”\n\n\nOther Feature\n\nAny other longer articles that do not fit one of the above categories\n\n\nThe categories list developed over time and reflects the project’s evolution as well as the changes within the periodical."

Because we knew it would be impossible to assemble a comprehensive corpus of every author in our institutional dataset and because we knew that many authors who attended the IWW never published work, when building our corpus in collaboration with HTRC we used two selection criteria. First, we searched HTRC’s collections for works by any author listed as director of a IWW graduate’s thesis. Secondly, given that we intend our database to drive a public-facing web service, we searched for authors from Wikipedia’s “List of Iowa Writers’ Workshop people,” as this list constituted an example of an externally and publicly defined list of notable IWW authors. We also felt these criteria would maximize our success rate at finding published works for our author list.\nThe volume publication data and metadata provided follow the model established by Ted Underwood’s dataset submitted to the Post45 Collective. Along with author and title information, we have listed each volume’s publisher as well as publication date and location (from MARC metadata).

Other than gender, we have not tagged any of our entries with demographic data that might be considered sensitive or subjective.\nThe gender information for authors in this data was collected by researching biographical information available on authors included in our database. When no biographical information on an author was available, the PEP team attempted to infer (when possible) the author’s most likely gender based on name. While there are instances where an individual author’s gender identity information may not be discernable, our data does allow for a reliable aggregate examination of gender trends in the IWW over time."

    "section": "Significance and Context",
    "text": "Significance and Context\nNordic Noir – crime fiction originating in the Nordic region – is one of the most significant international publishing success stories of the twenty-first century. It is often associated with Stieg Larsson’s posthumously published Millennium trilogy (2005-2007), which has morphed into an ongoing franchise with film adaptations and bestselling continuation novels. With global sales in excess of 100 million across all formats, this series ranks among the biggest megasellers of our time (Steiner 2014; Berglund 2017, 2022). The Millennium books, however, are not an isolated event. They form part of a wave of hundreds of books by Nordic crime writers which have experienced success beyond their country of origin. As such, the Nordic Noir boom is likely the biggest global publishing phenomenon originating outside the English language – far outstripping, for example, the Latin American literary fiction boom of the 1960s and 1970s. Nordic Noir is a prime manifestation of crime fiction as a literary genre that is not only based on transnational exchanges, but also circulates internationally at scale and with comparative ease (Gulddal and King 2022).\nDespite its importance, Nordic Noir has not previously been mapped in terms of its circulation as world literature. To address this gap, The Nordic Noir in Translation Database 2000–2020 (NNTD) provides bibliographic information of the translation flows of all crime fiction from the five main Nordic languages during the period of the so-called “Nordic Noir boom”. Nordic Noir was already being translated beyond the Nordic languages prior to the 2000s – notable examples include Sjöwall & Wahlöö’s Martin Beck series (1965-1975), Henning Mankell’s Wallander series (1991-2009) and individual novels such as Peter Høeg’s Frøken Smillas fornemmelse for sne (1992; Miss Smilla’s Feeling for Snow, 2003). However, it was only at the after the turn of the millennium that it became a mass phenomenon, and that the terms Scandinoir or Nordic Noir gained currency as global brands. The NNTD’s timeframe, 2000-2020, therefore captures the rise of Nordic Noir in the early 2000s and the genre’s peak following the global success of Stieg Larsson’s Millennium trilogy (2005-2007) around 2010.\nWhile particularly relevant to crime fiction scholars, the dataset will also be useful for scholars in the fields of world literature, comparative literature, book history, publishing studies, sociology of literature and translation studies. The NNTD provides a unique resource for scholars studying the circulation of world literature in the 21st century, particularly in the context of genre fiction, bestsellers and other kinds of commercially oriented fiction as well as in relation to the structures and agents of the book trade. Since it charts translation flows from (semi-)peripheral languages, it offers useful data for scholars working comparatively with a focus on such language areas.\nSpecific (hypothetical) user profiles include:\n\nCrime fiction scholars interested in mapping and comparing international dissemination patterns as well as the overall extent of crime fiction circulating in translation. In particular, the data enables studies of the timeline, scope, reach and impact of the Nordic Noir phenomenon.\nPublishing studies scholars focusing on the international circulation of contemporary genre fiction as well as on bestsellers, international rights sales and industry drivers of global success.\nComparative literature scholars working on global literary translation flows and their impact in the form of reception and formal/stylistic influence.\nTranslation studies scholars interested in contemporary trends and translation flows on a macro scale.\n\nIn parallel with this this dataset, we have published a research article in Translation Studies (Berglund, Gulddal and King). In this article, we discuss some key findings related to the NNTD, including the exceptional volume of translations, the growth rates over the studied period, the Swedish dominance, and the impact of certain bestselling authors. At the time of writing, the data has not been used by anyone else. No other similar or overlapping datasets are available, publicly or otherwise."

    "section": "Collection and Creation",
    "text": "Collection and Creation\nSeparate data sources and data collection methods have been used for each language. The data for Danish crime fiction was extracted from 1) the “Translators Database”, a bibliographic resource maintained by the Danish Arts Foundation (DAF) and covering translations of Danish literature across all genres, and 2) a dataset of international rights sales by Danish publishers and agents in the period 2010-2020, also acquired from the DAF. For Finnish crime fiction data was drawn from “Finnish literature in translation”, a database compiled by the Finnish Literature Exchange (FILI) listing all book-length volumes of Finnish, Finland Swedish and Sami literature in translation. The data for Icelandic crime fiction was provided by the National and University Library of Iceland (NULI), which has a long-standing policy of purchasing print copies of all translations of Icelandic books and hence has virtually complete records of translated crime fiction. The bibliographic data for Norwegian crime fiction was compiled using the Norwegian national bibliography – “Nasjonalbibliografien” – as it appears in the digital database Oria which, in theory, includes all Norwegian literature in translation. The bibliographic data for Swedish crime fiction in translation was based on LIBRIS, the catalogue of all Swedish academic and research libraries. For details, see the Bibliography and the methods and material discussion in the research article (Berglund, Gulddal and King).\nThe definition of crime fiction has been operationalised differently across the five languages in line with what was practically achievable. For Norwegian and Swedish, the points of departure are comprehensive crime fiction bibliographies compiled by genre experts. Covering almost all crime fiction published in their respective countries, these bibliographies use an “inclusive” genre definition that encompasses all sub-genres: whodunnits, hardboiled, detective fiction, spy fiction, thrillers, psychological suspense novels, genre hybrids, etc. For Danish, Finnish and Icelandic, genre categorisation is based on library and book-trade classifications available in the collected data. Yet, even though the agents are different, they base their classifications on similar definitions of crime fiction. The broad definition of crime fiction as fiction ‘focusing on crime’, which is favoured by crime fiction bibliographers as well as by most crime fiction scholars, is close to the “umbrella genre” of crime and suspense used in both contemporary book publishing and in libraries (cf. Berglund 2021). All sources used for defining crime fiction are listed in the Bibliography.\nThe data aggregated from these resources has been manually curated by the authors of the dataset, but this curation only involves aspects such as harmonisation, syntax, and spelling. In practice, this means that we have corrected misspelled name variations and harmonised syntax in the author column (e.g. changed “Camilla Lackberg” and “Läckberg, Camilla” to “Camilla Läckberg”); harmonised original titles and deleted occasional genre indicators (e.g. changed “Sorgenfri: En Harry Hole-thriller” to “Sorgenfri”) in the source_title column; and harmonised language names and corrected misspellings in the target language column (e.g. changed “Slovakian” and “slovak” to “Slovak”). For languages, we have followed the names given in the ISO language code list."

    "text": "Description\nThe dataset contains information organized by seven variables:\nauthor ⇒ The author of the translated book.\noriginal_title ⇒ The title of the translated book in its original source language.\noriginal_language ⇒ The source language of the translated book.\noriginal_publication_year ⇒ The year of first publication in the source language.\ntranslated_title ⇒ The main title of the translated book.\ntranslated_language ⇒ The target language of the translated book. In the few cases (10 in total)  where the translated title was not available in the bibliographic sources used and where we were unable to retrieve it in other ways, we have either provided the name of the original title or identified the language of the title, i.e. “[chinese title]”.1\ntranslated_publication_year ⇒ The year the book was published in translation.\nThe NNTD comprises bibliographic records of – in theory – all translations of Nordic crime fiction for adults, written in any of the five main Nordic languages (Danish, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish) and published in translation during the period 2000–2020. The dataset is delimited to include only first edition translations published in print book form. We have included the “in theory” qualification because we acknowledge that quantitative investigations of bibliographic data involve statistical loss, and that this general problem is exacerbated in the translation context because compilers of national bibliographies tend not to prioritise outbound translations. Accordingly, we concur with previous scholarship on global translation patterns (Heilbron 1999; Lindqvist 2016) that exact numbers are impossible to produce, and that any dataset related to global translation flows – including the NNTD – should be understood as evidence-based indications of tendencies. The international sources available for studying translation, such as the Index Translationum (IT), unfortunately suffer from severe methodological problems and have large gaps (Heilbron 2000; Svedjedal 2012). Because the NNTD draws only on bibliographic information at the national level, which is generally much more reliable than the IT, we are confident that it is as complete as can be achieved. For further discussion, see our research article based on this dataset (Berglund, Gulddal and King).\nThe dataset is available in a matrix format as one csv file, consisting of 8,886 rows (one row per translation event) and seven columns. The columns cover the key parameters: author(s); original title; original year of publication; source language; title in translation; target language; and year published in translation. The dataset thus covers 8,886 translation events of Nordic crime fiction during the period 2000-2020, distributed over 408 unique authors and author constellations, and 1,588 unique translated titles. Further descriptive statistics concerning the composition of the dataset can be found in the associated research article. These parameters are with very few exceptions complete for all rows in the dataset. All information has been checked manually against national biographical databases. The only exception is the column “title” (in translation), where such checking was not always possible for practical reasons.\nIt would have been valuable to include other parameters in the dataset, including original publisher; publisher of the translation; and translator(s). However, the nature of our sources made it impossible to collect this data in a structured and systematic way."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Juliana Spahr and Stephanie Young—joined in co-authorship, later, by Claire Grossman—were poets who began to notice something: “at most of the readings we attend, the room is mainly white.” This observation bothered them. They gathered anecdotes. They queried friends. When they heard about rooms that were other-than-white, they sought them out “only to find that they no longer existed or barely existed.” Something was wrong with poetry, so they set out to learn more. Early in their research they realized that if they wanted to know the truth about whiteness and US poetry they would need more than anecdotes. They would need data: lots of data.\nThey thought that creative writing programs might be less white, but they were wrong. They thought that prizewinners might be less white, and found that, though prizes were more racially equitable in the twenty-first century, the winners shared elite educational backgrounds. They thought that technology—desktop publishing, the internet—might have democratized publishing, but they learned that racism, Ivy League degrees, and elite creative writing programs maintain gross inequality in poetry.\nGrossman, Spahr, and Young aren’t alone in recognizing two facts: contemporary literature is vast; and awash in data. While they surveyed rooms and rosters, literary scholars across the US had also quietly begun gathering data to document the complex, interlocking system of literary prejudice and prestige. Conspicuous blurbs create networks that subtly organize the field into coteries. Online social media platforms have resurrected and repurposed authorship. One scholar collected Publishers Weekly bestseller lists for fiction between 1950 and 2000 and discovered that 98% of the titles were written by white authors. Meanwhile, a graduate student at the University of Chicago gathered The New York Times’ bestseller lists for his dissertation. And a professor at the University of New Orleans, wanting to address the silence of African American literature on these lists, assembled Essence’s bestseller lists that captured hugely popular books like Omar Tyree’s Flyy Girl and Sister Souljah’s The Coldest Winter Ever that the mainstream lists failed to register.\nIncreased scholarly attention to data is the complement to a changing literary culture. “The personal computer, mobile devices, the cloud, the server farm, the search engine, the algorithm, and the network are now indispensable parts of daily life,” write Jessica Pressman and Aarthi Vadde. “They are equally indispensable to the reading, writing, and distribution of literature.” Thanks to ebooks and the ease of self-publishing, the number of fiction titles published in the US each year increased, between 1990 and 2010, by a factor of ten, from around 5000 to more than 50,000. Since 2013, that number has risen above 70,000. Among this vastness, new genres proliferate like mushrooms after a rain, none more “quintessential,” argues Mark McGurl, than Adult Baby Diaper Erotica. The participatory culture of web 2.0 has lent itself to immense collections of fan fiction at fanfiction.net and on Wattpad. More and more people listen to audiobooks. The performance of authorship in the digital literary sphere is defined against participatory culture, whether one is an enthusiastic participant, like Margaret Atwood, or a curmudgeonly holdout, like Jonathan Franzen—or a curmudgeonly participant, describing works of autofiction as “wan little husks.” Increasingly, publishers look for large social media follower counts from prospective authors who, in turn, often live Very Online. Sales can be driven by tears on TikTok.\nAt this point, data is the foundation of contemporary literary culture. Prominent novelists such as Teju Cole, Joshua Cohen, and Jennifer Egan have, for some years, been provoking us—through Twitter fiction, livestreaming the writing of a novel, and incorporating PowerPoint into a novel—to update our accounts of literature’s material culture in the digital age. We ought to recognize data’s function in much the way book historians have long recognized the role of print technology in production, circulation, and reception: from the printing press to offset printing to the mimeograph to desktop publishing. Adobe’s Portable Document Format was to the 1990s what wood pulp was to the 1860s. The work is ongoing. Scholars have written literary histories of word processing and the digital literary sphere, not to mention critiques of the exorbitant energy and military histories of the infrastructure that stores this voluminous data. But what about the data itself?\nThe data is voluminous, and the process of collecting it has only begun. Not long ago, we noticed that data collection in literary studies was happenstance. Some scholars in California wanted to investigate the whiteness of poetry, so they started filling spreadsheets. Some scholars in Iowa wanted to understand the influence of the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, so they started filling spreadsheets. One of us began filling spreadsheets with information about literary agents. One of us began filling spreadsheets with lists from publishing imprints. But we were figuring out how to do it as we went, more or less separately. We lacked criteria for what good data collection looked like. We knew we wanted to share our data eventually, but we didn’t know how best to do so. And we knew that this data, collected by these scholars, would be much more powerful together than separate.\nWe—Laura and Dan—decided to form a collective to address the challenges that we and our colleagues were beginning to face. We formed an editorial board. We partnered with the journal Post45 and the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship. We launched the Post45 Data Collective in April 2021.\nThe Post45 Data Collective peer reviews and houses post-1945 literary data on our open-access website, for use, reuse, research, and teaching. Copyright prevents us from hosting literature itself, so we include, whenever possible, IDs that allow users to access texts in the HathiTrust digital library and study them through the HathiTrust Research Center. The Data Collective hosts, as of today: a series of datasets that describe who attended the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, their advisor, and the title of their thesis, among other metadata. Building a dataset is difficult work that ought to be cited and recognized by institutions; to make that easier, we send datasets through double-blind peer review and, upon acceptance, issue them a Digital Object Identifier, or DOI, to enable citation. Several further datasets stand in the queue. These include weekly bestseller lists for fiction from The New York Times, black bestseller lists from Essence, and the data about poetry and prizes that undergirded the landmark scholarship by Claire Grossman, Juliana Spahr, and Stephanie Young.\nImagine what will be possible. One day soon we will be able to map the network of the literary field. We will be able to trace connections between literary agents, blurbs, editors, imprints, and Goodreads reviews to prizes and institutions of higher ed. We will be able to investigate tax documents from conglomerates to understand how they manage publishers and film studios. We will be able to study the influence of these networks and this management—for better and, certainly, for worse—on literature itself. This is a beginning. It’s time."

    "section": "Significance & Context",
    "text": "Significance & Context\nFrederic Jameson famously argued that speculative fiction’s “deepest vocation is over and over again to demonstrate and to dramatize our incapacity to imagine the future” (Jameson 1982). Across the history of the genre, are there patterns in this utopian failure? Is there a shape to its limits? Did writers in the 1950s have a further time horizon than writers in the 2010s?\nThe Time Horizons of Futuristic Fiction dataset collects 2,564 English-language narrative works set in the future, each marked with the year it was released and the year it takes place. These works include films (961), fiction (772), television series and episodes (377), video games (325), comics (75), radio drama (36), and other media. The works were published between 1733 and 2024, with ~94% published after 1945. The futures they depict range from 1840 CE to 100 trillion CE, though most depict near futures; a quarter of the works are set within a decade of their release date, 58% within fifty years, and 69% within a century.\nWe originally scraped this information from Wikidata, as well as lists and category pages on Wikipedia. We then submitted it to a rigorous set of rules for cleaning and verification. To cast the widest net possible, our primary selection criterion was any narrative work whose temporal setting is at least one year later than the year of that work’s release. We chose not to restrict our search for works based on their description as speculative fiction (SF) in Wikidata or Wikipedia, in order to avoid excluding works that some observers may or may not consider counting as SF. Further, SF is a genre that includes works set in the present (Jupiter Ascending, dir. Wachowskis [2015]) and past (William Gibson’s Pattern Recognition [2003], set in 2002). And many works of fiction otherwise considered to be realist or “mundane” are set in the future. Due to the fluid nature of genres and their classification, the cleanest possible selection criterion was thus to search for narrative works set in the future, relative to their release date.\nThat said, it’s worth acknowledging the obvious relationship between SF and futurity. A pathbreaking work of academic SF criticism—I.F. Clarke’s The Pattern of Expectation, 1644–2001 (Clarke 1979)—argued that the genre’s defining feature is the depiction of the future. More recently, Sheryl Vint noted that leading SF writers “agree that SF is not a genre of prediction, but that it does have a relationship to ideas about futurity even, or perhaps especially when it gets the specific details wrong. . . . Qualities central to SF [are] worldmaking, futurity, cultural change” (Vint 2021, 156–65). The relationship between SF and futurity is borne out in the data published here. For example, 28% of the fiction in our data is included among the works in the Classics of Science Fiction database, which “identifies the books and short stories that are most remembered based on how often they are cited by awards, best-of-lists, polls, editors, scholars, and other sources of recognition.” In other words, about 28% of the fiction we identified as being set in the future is among the most influential works in the history of speculative fiction.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first project that systematically measures the depiction of the future in fiction. Despite SF’s rich history of fan-led bibliographic data collection projects almost since the inception of the genre (Forlini et al. 2016) and a growing number of data curation projects in academic SF studies (Boswell 2021), a dataset of future narrative dates across authors and narrative universes hasn’t been collected until now.\nThis dataset will be of interest to researchers in SF studies, as well to scholars interested more broadly in the history of cultural attitudes toward the future and in ways of conceptualizing narrative time. Analyzing and visualizing the data could suggest trends in the evolution of how speculative fiction has imagined the future. This dataset could also be productively compared with data tracking the depiction of the past in works of historical fiction (English 2016; Manshel 2017). Possible research questions this dataset could support include:\n\nDoes critical acclaim correlate with near- or far-futures?\nAre works of climate fiction now set closer to the present as the effects of global warming are felt more acutely in daily life?\nDo near- versus far-future settings correlate with stylistic differences in the texts? Are far-future settings de facto less realist, less concrete?\nThere’s an assumption in SF studies that the past twenty years have seen the genre shift toward nearer-future visions, in part because accelerating technological change makes it difficult to project beyond a decade or two from now (Hollinger 2006). Is this true?"

    "section": "Fuzzy Years",
    "text": "Fuzzy Years\nThe first problem is that many of the entries had incomplete information for year_set: some works were given no future date at all and others contained only the general period the work was set in. So, we flagged all entries with empty or rounded dates and engaged in some detective work to track down specific future years. For example, because Larry Niven’s Ringworld (1970) was listed under the Wikipedia category “Novels set in the 29th century,” we originally entered the rounded year 2800 and flagged it for later follow-up.\nTo find specific years, we browsed resources like IMDb, Fandom wikis, Goodreads, StackExchage, fan sites, and the full text of the work. Sometimes, the date isn’t given in the work itself, but rather in paratext like an author interview, a promotional poster, or a movie trailer (For example, the jacket copy of a 2013 edition of J.G. Ballard’s The Drowned World [1962] describes a work set in 2145, a date given nowhere in the text. A 1921 poster advertising the opening of Karel Čapek’s Rossum’s Universal Robots (1920) promises a play set in the year 2000, while the work itself contains no specific year [Klima 2001].)\nOther times, we relied on future years that were deduced by fans. Countless debates are waged online among fans over the dating of events in franchises like Divergent and Foundation. Some works have in-universe dating systems: BXT (Before Extrasolar Technology) and XTE (Extrasolar Technology Era) in The Expanse series, BX and AX (Before and After the Xenocide) in the Ender’s Game series, BG and AG (Before and After the Guild) in Dune. In order to convert a work’s in-universe date to the real-world CE system of our dataset, we identified one event in the narrative world that fans gave both an in-universe and real-world date. The conversion of these dates is obviously a matter of conjecture (especially if characters don’t follow Earth’s solar year!). But the ways fans establish these future chronologies is not unlike the process of dating historical events in the premodern period. (There are no fewer than five competing chronologies for converting dates in the ancient events in ancient Babylonia, for example.)\nIt’s important to note in the case of these works that while fans care intensely about deducing specific dates, those dates may run counter to the intent of the authors, who sometimes want to set their work in an indefinite future. All works whose year_set needed to be hunted down beyond the information on Wikipedia and Wikidata include an entry in the verify_yr column detailing where we found this information. In other words, if a researcher wishes to isolate works whose precise future date needed to be refined using sources other than Wikipedia (about 10% of the entire dataset), they can do so by filtering for records that contain a verify_yr entry."

    "text": "Broad Epochs\nThe next problem we encountered was that some entries included a date range spanning multiple years. So, we created a new field, multiyears, to preserve the original date ranges. We then established a set of rules for distilling that range down to a single number for the year_set field.\nOur first method for determining year_set was to choose a year based on our familiarity with the work, if we knew it or if its plot summary on Wikipedia made the temporal framing clear. This way, if the majority of the narrative takes place in a single temporal setting coupled with brief framing stories, momentary time travel, or flash-backs and -forwards, we entered the year_set in which the narrative primarily takes place. For example, Wikipedia’s entry for Terminator 2 (1991) contained the future dates 1995-1997; 2029. But the film’s 2029 is a brief flash-forward and we knew that the rest of the narrative primarily takes place in 1995, the year we entered.\nIn all other cases, we proceeded as follows. When faced with a two-year range, we simply rounded down (1986-1987 → 1986), assuming that’s when the story begins. Some works are set across a much longer period, whether time proceeds organically (like the TV show Years and Years (2019), which spans 2019-2034 over the course of the series), or with discontinuous leaps (like the film Bicentennial Man (1999), which visits multiple periods in equal portion: 2005, 2025, 2048, 2068, and 2205). For these works, we picked the median of the date range and rounded up to the closest year if necessary (2019-2034 → 2027). We decided to use median rather than mean, since the median is more likely to be near a year actually depicted in the work. (E.g. 2002, 2041, 2073, and 8932 produce a mean of 3762 CE, but its median of 2057 CE is closer to the era depicted in the work.)\nThis approach is a slightly awkward fit for a small number of works containing large leaps in time, like Stephen Baxter’s Ring (1994), which trades off between two narrative timelines, 3951 CE and 5,000,000 CE, producing a median of 2,501,975 CE. It also means that six works in the dataset depicting historical as well as future events ended up with a median year_set date earlier than the work’s release date. (Cixin Liu’s The Three Body Problem [2006], set in 1967, 1971, 1979, and 2010, has a median year_set of 1975, thirty-one years before the work was published). We made an exception to the median rule for these six works with narrative threads trading off between the past and the future — Weapons of Choice, The Three Body Problem, Cloud Atlas, The Bone Clocks, Walk the Vanished Earth, and Cloud Cuckoo Land — and instead picked the farthest future date depicted, given the dataset’s topic of concern. \nOverall, we found using the median of multiyear settings to be the cleanest way of creating a column of individual future years that allows for plotting the time horizons of individual works over the genre’s history. Should researchers want to analyze or visualize all the years depicted in the works, they can use the numbers in the multiyears column. Fuzzy date ranges can be worked with using Python libraries like tempun for temporal uncertainty and undate for incomplete dates."

    "text": "Episodes and Series\nOne final problem we encountered revolved around the inclusion of individual installments or episodes from larger narrative worlds. Our initial pull from Wikidata gathered hundreds of individual episodes from franchises like Star Trek, Dr. Who, The Twilight Zone, and more, with each season or series set at a particular time. There was a cluster of ~175 works around the 2360s, for example, when Star Trek: The Next Generation was set. We didn’t want to remove all these individual works, but we also didn’t want them to skew the data: an author’s decision to set a single novel set in 2211 should be just as important as a showrunner deciding to set the series of TNG in the 2360s.\nFor the most part, we leave it up to researchers to decide how to count or filter these episodes or installments. We created a field called is_series for works that are episodes within a broader series. That field contains the Wikidata Q-id for the series itself (for example, Virtual Light is a 1993 novel with the Q-id Q897105, and it is an installment in William Gibson’s Bridge trilogy with the Q-id Q630048). Some works with a value for is_series contain only one entry (like the novel Leviathan Wakes in The Expanse series). For any single entry that is itself a series published over multiple years, we used the year that work was first published in the year_released column and if necessary, followed the rules outlined above for distilling multiyears down to a single year_set. \nCoverage for these series is not complete. We did not go back through the Enderverse wiki, for example, to enter all the novels in Orson Scott Card’s Ender’s Game series. This task would have led us away from the dataset’s “authorship” by Wikipedia users, presented a potentially endless set of rabbit holes for narrative universes with extensive back catalogs, and weighted the dataset’s dates in favor of those fictional worlds. Instead, we only included works whose future dates have been documented on Wikipedia.\nAs a franchise, Star Trek was especially tricky because of the sheer number of episodes (&gt;800 in total) and the specificity of their temporal setting (100-200 works per TV series in the specific decade of its setting). We were worried these dates would overwhelm the data and skew any conclusions drawn from them. To reduce the number of entries, we decided to treat Star Trek as a special case, only including entries for 12 TV series and 13 studio films, rather than every individual episode. For anyone interested in the episode-by-episode dates, the Star Trek API (STAPI) draws on the fan wiki Memory Alpha and has the most comprehensive chronological data through its stardate and year fields. The second most represented franchise in our dataset was Dr. Who (~100 entries), whose individual episodes we decided to leave in because their dates are so diverse. “Scavenger” (2014), for example, is set in 2071 while “Hell Bent” (2015) is set in 4,500,002,000 CE."

And Gregory Benford’s In the Ocean of the Night (1978) was originally set in 1999, then 2019 when republished seven years later.

In those cases, Wikipedia lists the work as being set in the future but gives no specific date, and we weren’t able to find one ourselves. A few works deliberately kept the year ambiguous by using non-numeric characters. For Half-Life (1998), a video game set “May 16, 200-”, we entered 2005, roughly the median of that decade. We chose similar medians for any year employing an “X”, like Mega Man 2 (famously set in “20XX”), for which we entered 2050 as that century’s median."

Between them, they bring a wealth of knowledge about 20th and 21st century literature, digital humanities, and data science—as well as extensive experience curating and publishing cultural data (see Xander’s NEA fellowship dataset).\nThis transition also means that Dan Sinykin, who founded the Post45 Data Collective with Laura McGrath in 2021 and has led the Collective since then, will be stepping back to the Editorial Board. This project would not what it is today without Dan’s ambition, vision, fastidious email communication, and hilarious social media game.\nIn his fantastic L.A. Review of Books piece, “Fuck the Poetry Police,” Dan laid out a dream for the project:\n\nThe idealistic aspiration of the Post45 Data Collective…is a total map of the cultural industries. Imagine if we could link the “Major Literary Prizes” dataset with the agents who represented the winning books, the editors who edited them, the houses that published them, and the venues that reviewed them. Imagine if we could do something similar with film, TV, music, video games, and the parent companies that own them. We could lay bare the mechanisms that maintain hierarchies across the arts. A total map would do more than sociological work: it would transform our interpretations.\n\nWe’ve made great strides toward mapping the cultural industries under Dan’s leadership. With our new tripartite editorial crew, we will continue on this journey and plan to bring you even more exciting datasets, humanities data tools, . Stay tuned! And thanks for everything, Dan!"

    "text": "Significance & Context\nFrederic Jameson famously argued that speculative fiction’s “deepest vocation is over and over again to demonstrate and to dramatize our incapacity to imagine the future” (Jameson 1982). Across the history of the genre, are there patterns in this utopian failure? Is there a shape to its limits? Did writers in the 1950s have a further time horizon than writers in the 2010s?\nThe Time Horizons of Futuristic Fiction dataset collects 2,564 English-language narrative works set in the future, each marked with the year it was released and the year it takes place. These works include films (961), fiction (772), television series and episodes (377), video games (325), comics (75), radio drama (36), and other media. The works were published between 1733 and 2024, with ~94% published after 1945. The futures they depict range from 1840 CE to 100 trillion CE, though most depict near futures; a quarter of the works are set within a decade of their release date, 58% within fifty years, and 69% within a century.\nWe originally scraped this information from Wikidata, as well as lists and category pages on Wikipedia. We then submitted it to a rigorous set of rules for cleaning and verification. To cast the widest net possible, our primary selection criterion was any narrative work whose temporal setting is at least one year later than the year of that work’s release. We chose not to restrict our search for works based on their description as speculative fiction (SF) in Wikidata or Wikipedia, in order to avoid excluding works that some observers may or may not consider counting as SF. Further, SF is a genre that includes works set in the present (Jupiter Ascending, dir. Wachowskis [2015]) and past (William Gibson’s Pattern Recognition [2003], set in 2002). And many works of fiction otherwise considered to be realist or “mundane” are set in the future. Due to the fluid nature of genres and their classification, the cleanest possible selection criterion was thus to search for narrative works set in the future, relative to their release date.\nThat said, it’s worth acknowledging the obvious relationship between SF and futurity. A pathbreaking work of academic SF criticism—I.F. Clarke’s The Pattern of Expectation, 1644–2001 (Clarke 1979)—argued that the genre’s defining feature is the depiction of the future. More recently, Sheryl Vint noted that leading SF writers “agree that SF is not a genre of prediction, but that it does have a relationship to ideas about futurity even, or perhaps especially when it gets the specific details wrong. . . . Qualities central to SF [are] worldmaking, futurity, cultural change” (Vint 2021, 156–65). The relationship between SF and futurity is borne out in the data published here. For example, 28% of the fiction in our data is included among the works in the Classics of Science Fiction database, which “identifies the books and short stories that are most remembered based on how often they are cited by awards, best-of-lists, polls, editors, scholars, and other sources of recognition.” In other words, about 28% of the fiction we identified as being set in the future is among the most influential works in the history of speculative fiction.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first project that systematically measures the depiction of the future in fiction. Despite SF’s rich history of fan-led bibliographic data collection projects almost since the inception of the genre (Forlini et al. 2016) and a growing number of data curation projects in academic SF studies (Boswell 2021), a dataset of future narrative dates across authors and narrative universes hasn’t been collected until now.\nThis dataset will be of interest to researchers in SF studies, as well to scholars interested more broadly in the history of cultural attitudes toward the future and in ways of conceptualizing narrative time. Analyzing and visualizing the data could suggest trends in the evolution of how speculative fiction has imagined the future. This dataset could also be productively compared with data tracking the depiction of the past in works of historical fiction (English 2016; Manshel 2017). Possible research questions this dataset could support include:\n\nDoes critical acclaim correlate with near- or far-futures?\nAre works of climate fiction now set closer to the present as the effects of global warming are felt more acutely in daily life?\nDo near- versus far-future settings correlate with stylistic differences in the texts? Are far-future settings de facto less realist, less concrete?\nThere’s an assumption in SF studies that the past twenty years have seen the genre shift toward nearer-future visions, in part because accelerating technological change makes it difficult to project beyond a decade or two from now (Hollinger 2006). Is this true?"

    "section": "Fuzzy Years",
    "text": "Fuzzy Years\nThe first problem is that many of the entries had incomplete information for year_set: some works were given no future date at all and others contained only the general period the work was set in. So, we flagged all entries with empty or rounded dates and engaged in some detective work to track down specific future years. For example, because Larry Niven’s Ringworld (1970) was listed under the Wikipedia category “Novels set in the 29th century,” we originally entered the rounded year 2800 and flagged it for later follow-up.\nTo find specific years, we browsed resources like IMDb, Fandom wikis, Goodreads, StackExchage, fan sites, and the full text of the work. Sometimes, the date isn’t given in the work itself, but rather in paratext like an author interview, a promotional poster, or a movie trailer (For example, the jacket copy of a 2013 edition of J.G. Ballard’s The Drowned World [1962] describes a work set in 2145, a date given nowhere in the text. A 1921 poster advertising the opening of Karel Čapek’s Rossum’s Universal Robots (1920) promises a play set in the year 2000, while the work itself contains no specific year [Klima 2001].)\nOther times, we relied on future years that were deduced by fans. Countless debates are waged online among fans over the dating of events in franchises like Divergent and Foundation. Some works have in-universe dating systems: BXT (Before Extrasolar Technology) and XTE (Extrasolar Technology Era) in The Expanse series, BX and AX (Before and After the Xenocide) in the Ender’s Game series, BG and AG (Before and After the Guild) in Dune. In order to convert a work’s in-universe date to the real-world CE system of our dataset, we identified one event in the narrative world that fans gave both an in-universe and real-world date. The conversion of these dates is obviously a matter of conjecture (especially if characters don’t follow Earth’s solar year!). But the ways fans establish these future chronologies is not unlike the process of dating historical events in the premodern period. (There are no fewer than five competing chronologies for converting dates in the ancient events in ancient Babylonia, for example.)\nIt’s important to note in the case of these works that while fans care intensely about deducing specific dates, those dates may run counter to the intent of the authors, who sometimes want to set their work in an indefinite future.

    "section": "Fuzzy Years",
    "text": "Fuzzy Years\nThe first problem is that many of the entries had incomplete information for year_set: some works were given no future date at all and others contained only the general period the work was set in. So, we flagged all entries with empty or rounded dates and engaged in some detective work to track down specific future years. For example, because Larry Niven’s Ringworld (1970) was listed under the Wikipedia category “Novels set in the 29th century,” we originally entered the rounded year 2800 and flagged it for later follow-up.\nTo find specific years, we browsed resources like IMDb, Fandom wikis, Goodreads, StackExchage, fan sites, and the full text of the work. Sometimes, the date isn’t given in the work itself, but rather in paratext like an author interview, a promotional poster, or a movie trailer (For example, the jacket copy of a 2013 edition of J.G. Ballard’s The Drowned World [1962] describes a work set in 2145, a date given nowhere in the text. A 1921 poster advertising the opening of Karel Čapek’s Rossum’s Universal Robots (1920) promises a play set in the year 2000, while the work itself contains no specific year [Klima 2001].)\nOther times, we relied on future years that were deduced by fans. Countless debates are waged online among fans over the dating of events in franchises like Divergent and Foundation. Some works have in-universe dating systems: BXT (Before Extrasolar Technology) and XTE (Extrasolar Technology Era) in The Expanse series, BX and AX (Before and After the Xenocide) in the Ender’s Game series, BG and AG (Before and After the Guild) in Dune. In order to convert a work’s in-universe date to the real-world CE system of our dataset, we identified one event in the narrative world that fans gave both an in-universe and real-world date. The conversion of these dates is obviously a matter of conjecture (especially if characters don’t follow Earth’s solar year!). But the ways fans establish these future chronologies is not unlike the process of dating historical events in the premodern period. (There are no fewer than five competing chronologies for converting dates in the ancient events in ancient Babylonia, for example.)\nIt’s important to note in the case of these works that while fans care intensely about deducing specific dates, those dates may run counter to the intent of the authors, who sometimes want to set their work in an indefinite future. All works whose year_set needed to be hunted down beyond the information on Wikipedia and Wikidata include an entry in the verify_yr column detailing where we found this information. In other words, if a researcher wishes to isolate works whose precise future date needed to be refined using sources other than Wikipedia (about 10% of the entire dataset), they can do so by filtering for records that contain a verify_yr entry."

    "section": "Broad Epochs",
    "text": "Broad Epochs\nThe next problem we encountered was that some entries included a date range spanning multiple years. So, we created a new field, multiyears, to preserve the original date ranges. We then established a set of rules for distilling that range down to a single number for the year_set field.\nOur first method for determining year_set was to choose a year based on our familiarity with the work, if we knew it or if its plot summary on Wikipedia made the temporal framing clear. This way, if the majority of the narrative takes place in a single temporal setting coupled with brief framing stories, momentary time travel, or flash-backs and -forwards, we entered the year_set in which the narrative primarily takes place. For example, Wikipedia’s entry for Terminator 2 (1991) contained the future dates 1995-1997; 2029. But the film’s 2029 is a brief flash-forward and we knew that the rest of the narrative primarily takes place in 1995, the year we entered for year_set. 2029, as a non-primary year, was instead preserved in the multiyears field.\nIn all other cases, we proceeded as follows. When faced with a two-year range, we simply rounded down (1986-1987 → 1986), assuming that’s when the story begins. Some works are set across a much longer period, whether time proceeds organically (like the TV show Years and Years (2019), which spans 2019-2034 over the course of the series), or with discontinuous leaps (like the film Bicentennial Man (1999), which visits multiple periods in equal portion: 2005, 2025, 2048, 2068, and 2205). For these works, we picked the median of the date range and rounded up to the closest year if necessary (2019-2034 → 2027). We decided to use median rather than mean, since the median is more likely to be near a year actually depicted in the work. (E.g. 2002, 2041, 2073, and 8932 produce a mean of 3762 CE, but its median of 2057 CE is closer to the era depicted in the work.)\nThis approach is a slightly awkward fit for a small number of works containing large leaps in time, like Stephen Baxter’s Ring (1994), which trades off between two narrative timelines, 3951 CE and 5,000,000 CE, producing a median of 2,501,975 CE. It also means that six works in the dataset depicting historical as well as future events ended up with a median year_set date earlier than the work’s release date. (Cixin Liu’s The Three Body Problem [2006], set in 1967, 1971, 1979, and 2010, has a median year_set of 1975, thirty-one years before the work was published). We made an exception to the median rule for these five works with narrative threads trading off between the past and the future — Weapons of Choice, The Three Body Problem, Cloud Atlas, The Bone Clocks, and Cloud Cuckoo Land — and instead picked the farthest future date depicted, given the dataset’s topic of concern.\nOverall, we found using the median of multiyear settings to be the cleanest way of creating a column of individual future years that allows for plotting the time horizons of individual works over the genre’s history. Should researchers want to analyze or visualize all the years depicted in the works, they can use the numbers in the multiyears column. Fuzzy date ranges can be worked with using Python libraries like tempun for temporal uncertainty and undate for incomplete dates."

    "section": "Episodes and Series",
    "text": "Episodes and Series\nOne final problem we encountered revolved around the inclusion of individual installments or episodes from larger narrative worlds. Our initial pull from Wikidata gathered hundreds of individual episodes from franchises like Star Trek, Dr. Who, The Twilight Zone, and more, with each season or series set at a particular time. There was a cluster of ~175 works around the 2360s, for example, when Star Trek: The Next Generation was set. We didn’t want to remove all these individual works, but we also didn’t want them to skew the data: an author’s decision to set a single novel set in 2211 should be just as important as a showrunner deciding to set the series of TNG in the 2360s.\nFor the most part, we leave it up to researchers to decide how to count or filter these episodes or installments. We created a field called is\\_series for works that are episodes within a broader series. That field contains the Wikidata Q-id for the series itself (for example, Virtual Light is a 1993 novel with the Q-id Q897105, and it is an installment in William Gibson’s Bridge trilogy with the Q-id Q630048). Some works with a value for is\\_series contain only one entry (like the novel Leviathan Wakes in The Expanse series). For any single entry that is itself a series published over multiple years, we used the year that work was first published in the year_released column and if necessary, followed the rules outlined above for distilling multiyears down to a single year_set.\nCoverage for these series is not complete. We did not go back through the Enderverse wiki, for example, to enter all the novels in Orson Scott Card’s Ender’s Game series. This task would have led us away from the dataset’s “authorship” by Wikipedia users, presented a potentially endless set of rabbit holes for narrative universes with extensive back catalogs, and weighted the dataset’s dates in favor of those fictional worlds. Instead, we only included works whose future dates have been documented on Wikipedia.\nAs a franchise, Star Trek was especially tricky because of the sheer number of episodes (&gt;800 in total) and the specificity of their temporal setting (100-200 works per TV series in the specific decade of its setting). We were worried these dates would overwhelm the data and skew any conclusions drawn from them. To reduce the number of entries, we decided to treat Star Trek as a special case, only including entries for 12 TV series and 13 studio films, rather than every individual episode. For anyone interested in the episode-by-episode dates, the Star Trek API (STAPI) draws on the fan wiki Memory Alpha and has the most comprehensive chronological data through its stardate and year fields. The second most represented franchise in our dataset was Dr. Who (~100 entries), whose individual episodes we decided to leave in because their dates are so diverse. “Scavenger” (2014), for example, is set in 2071 while “Hell Bent” (2015) is set in 4,500,002,000 CE."

    "section": "Unclear Dates",
    "text": "Unclear Dates\nA final note on some outliers: several continuing series and republished novels revised their narrative timelines as the present caught up with the author’s imagined future. The Martian Chronicles (1950) originally depicted events from 1999 to 2026. When it was republished in 1997, the future dates given in the work shifted three decades forward. Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968) was originally set in 1992 while later editions depict 2021. The 1982 imagined in Isaac Asimov’s “Robbie” (1939) was moved to 1998 when revised for a 1950 republication. And Gregory Benford’s In the Ocean of the Night (1978) was originally set in 1999, then 2019 when republished seven years later. We always entered the original publication date and the future year used in these works’ first editions, noting the change in temporal setting during republication in the notes field.\nFinally, the year_set field for ten works contain NaN (not a number). In those cases, Wikipedia lists the work as being set in the future but gives no specific date, and we weren’t able to find one ourselves. A few works deliberately kept the year ambiguous by using non-numeric characters. For Half-Life (1998), a video game set “May 16, 200-”, we entered 2005, roughly the median of that decade. We chose similar medians for any year employing an “X”, like Mega Man 2 (famously set in “20XX”), for which we entered 2050 as that century’s median."

    "text": "Metadata Discussion\nPrize names: For purposes of aggregation, we decided to normalize historic prize names to their contemporary forms in addition to their prize_id column. This was done with an additional column (prize_alias) that clarifies that, for instance, the “Whitbread Biography,” “Whitbread Biography Award,” and “Costa Biography” are all part of the same prize series even though they have gone by different names at different times. The same is the case with the “Booker” and the “Man Booker.”\nPrize dates include prizes awarded from 1990 to 2022. Although some of the prizes in the SBLP data were instituted much earlier, these dates were decided to indicate recent trends among shortlisted and winning authors. Further, the establishment of newer awards like Women’s and Ted Hughes allows for comparisons across older ones such as James Tait and the Booker within a similar time frame without creating too many data discrepancies.\nEthnicity was labeled primarily by the ways in which authors identified themselves. The sources were the same as those for compiling the data on the authors, with the 2021 UK census classifications and UK Guidelines for Writing about Ethnicity as points of reference. Our aim is to “decouple ethnicity, as it functions in the dominant discourse, from its equivalence with nationalism, imperialism, racism and the state, which are the points of attachment around which a distinctive British or, more accurately, English ethnicity have been constructed” (Hall). A further discussion of the knotty ethical considerations of collecting ethnicity data is included below.\nGender and Sexuality of an author is understood to be fluid. The author’s self-identification of gender was prioritized over other gender assignments. Some gender assignments and pronouns may have subsequently changed from the three used in the data: “man,” “woman,” and “non-binary.” Unless self-identified as “queer” (which includes LBGTQ2+), an author’s sexuality is listed as “unknown,” to indicate that sexuality exists on a continuum between straight and queer, and to indicate that many straight authors do not feel the need to identify their sexuality explicitly, though it may be deduced from their biographies or interviews. We include sexuality because considering it allows for a politics of ethnicity premised on diversity and difference to emerge (Hall) and because it undermines the idea of cis hetero white Englishness as an unmarked but nevertheless normative ethnicity. Roughly six percent of the authors in the dataset identify as queer, and one author identified himself as straight.\nEducational classifications were based on the author’s highest degree. Data collected includes the institution where the authors acquired their degrees, degree institution country, and the level of highest degree attained. In addition, a set of degree field macro-categories was created to track patterns in academic training, while preserving data on the degree fields (which varied from person to person and institution to institution). The categories were Writing, Arts, History and Cultural Studies, Language and Literature, Law, Math, and Sciences, Philosophy and Theology, Politics and Economics, Medicine and Social Work, Multiple, none, and unknown. Here too, the information provided by the author was the first basis of the labels. In some cases, one or more of these pieces of information was not available. Where either the degree field, country, institution, or degree, or more than one of these was not traceable with certainty, it was listed as “unknown.”\nLinked Data: Finally, where viaf codes could be found for authors, these are included."

    "section": "Notes on Ethnic Identifications",
    "text": "Notes on Ethnic Identifications\nCollecting data to group authors’ ethnicity and making general claims about writers is perhaps the most challenging component of our research. Following important Black cultural studies work we recognize that both race and ethnicity are “discursive constructs” and “sliding signifiers.” Further, ethnic groups in official UK data combine different aspects of individual identity, and many of the categories are informed by historical ideas of race (Mirza). UK government guidelines for writing about ethnicity explicitly state that they refer to ethnicity and not race because: surveys usually ask people for their ethnicity and not their race; using consistent terms helps people to understand their data. We are aware that these guidelines obscure racial identifiers and racial biases.\nWe began by using the UK census categories but quickly found that they were not adequate to the complexities of our specific needs since they apply to UK citizens whereas our dataset includes international authors. Thus, we assembled three tiers of data. Self-identification of authors was recorded, as well as the UK census category if the author resided in the UK. In addition, all authors, both UK residents and international, were grouped into ethnicity macro categories. As the SBLP collects data on UK-based prizes, the ethnicity categories under which authors are grouped have a UK slant, even though sometimes these may not be as valid or as applicable in the case of international authors where other factors might have greater relevance.\nOnce the data had been compiled, a major question which emerged was granularity and whether it was possible to group certain definitions to make larger claims about white and non-white identities. As this is a common concern in data representation, we talked about the possibility of collapsing ethnicity classifications. Here we worked simultaneously with geographical location, cultural background, racial self-identification, and UK ethnicity categories. We worked with race, ethnicity and national assignments when we collapsed White Canadian, White American, White Australian, White New Zealander, White South African, Bulgarian, Croatian-Iranian American, Iranian American, Turkish American, Icelandic, Spanish, Dutch, German, Swedish, Albanian, Slavic Australian, English-Canadian into “Non-UK White.” Similarly, in “Estonian British,” “Chinese British,” or “British Mauritian,” the placement of British or another nationality first depended on various factors. Some authors hold dual nationalities while others claim British as their primary national identity though they may have lived in another country for most of their writerly careers. A select few may place either nationality first depending on where their books are published and the primary readership they hope to attract. Finally, some diasporic authors claim British nationality as primary though they may not yet have acquired formal UK citizenship.\nWe faced a similar ethical dilemma when deliberating whether to include Trinidadian British, Jamaican Chinese British, British Guyanese, Jamaican British under “British Caribbean,” as it flattens distinct Caribbean national identities. Moreover, as “British Caribbean” is more accepted than “Caribbean British,” the former does not accurately represent authors who place their island Caribbean identities foremost. We finally decided on “Caribbean,” as a macro category. Another added complication is that some ethnic groups are also nationalities such as Bangladeshi, Chinese, Indian, and Pakistani. Often there are clear cultural and religious connections between some of these groups; at other times these connections are less cultural than regional or geographic. We made considered decisions regarding other macro categories. Indian, Pakistani, Bengali, Bangladeshi, Malaysian, Sri Lankan, Hong Kong authors can be categorized as “South Asian” and/or “Asian.” We ultimately decided on “Asian” as a more capacious, though less geographically specific and culturally connected category.\nA few examples may help explain these complications. A major literary figure such as Caryl Phillips is subsumed under the macro ethnicity category “Caribbean” though in fact he was born in St. Kitts, educated and wrote in Britain, and has been based in the US for several decades. Phillips’ ethnicity in the appended Ethnicity Data Table as “Kittian British American” allows for capturing some of his multiple affiliations. Similarly, Gillian Slovo was born inSouth Africa but has lived in Britain since her family were political exiles there during the apartheid years. Her ethnicity comprises White South African roots and British domicile. Other instances of controversial categorization may be American born authors, Ottessa Moshfegh and Azadeh Moaveni, both of whom have Iranian parents, listed as “Non-UK White” in the ethnicity macro category.\nWe hope the ethnicity table accompanying the dataset will be useful to researchers who wish to examine the proximities of ethnicity to race, religion, nationality, language and sometimes country of domicile. As the administrative centers of the prizes are in the UK, the ethnic macro categories remain relevant to the data, despite these complications and contestations. Ethnicity data, even when categorized according to tidy data principles, remains complicated. Researchers who wish to categorize authors differently than the macro categories we use may do so using the parsed identities in the ethnicity table.\nWith these qualifications. ethnicity as used in the data accomplishes the following goals:\n\nchallenges pseudo-conceptualization and harmful actualization of race as a vertical hierarchy of white and Black/non-white by positing ethnicity as a horizontal relationality of cultural similarities/differences within and between groups;\n\nbypasses the biological essentialism and normative binarism that is currently associated with rigid racial classifications;\n\nexpresses the most effective articulations of ethnicity as cultural identities impacted by processes of globalization including the flow and movement of people, ideas, goods, capital, and technologies, though assimilationist hegemonic versions of ethnicity exist.\n\nUltimately, we developed the following macro categories which combine race, ethnicity, national affiliation and/or geography (the table below outlines the sub-categories): African, Asian, White American, Non-White American, Black British, Caribbean, Irish, Jewish, Non-U.K. White, unknown and White British. In Britain, as in other parts of the world mentioned in the macro categories, it is often difficult to distinguish various mixed-race ethnicities. We placed mixed race authors in the ethnic macro categories we developed, as explained at the beginning of this paragraph. Authors like Zadie Smith (one white and one black parent) or Hannah Lowe (one white and one mixed-race parent) are listed as Black British or Caribbean respectively based on the way they situate themselves in interviews, writings, promotion and publicity. Mixed race authors are not counted twice in the data."

Under multinational conglomerates, works of fiction have increasingly circulated across national borders; “bestsellers” serve the bottom line and work as advertisements for themselves just by being bestsellers. “International Bestsellers” provides the most comprehensive data on twenty-first-century bestsellers.\n“International Bestsellers” contains bestseller lists in fiction for France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United States, and periodic lists from 40 other countries, from June 2013 through December 2022. In total, the dataset contains 7,909 entries, each with eight columns of information, totaling 63,272 data points.\nNo other existing dataset covers twenty-first-century international bestsellers with information on author nationality, gender, publisher, and country of first publication. Thus, our dataset is relevant to post-1945 scholarship and will be especially useful for scholars in book history, publishing studies, sociology of literature, and twenty-first-century literary studies.\nThe dataset invites investigation into questions such as:\n\nWho are the bestselling authors of the early twenty-first century?\n\nWhat are the bestselling titles?\n\nWhich publishers have the greatest success selling in international markets?\n\nHow do the economics of multinational publishers affect the success of an international bestseller?\n\nWhat are the routes by which bestsellers travel from one national market to another?\n\nAnd in what ways do the gender and/or nationality of an author correspond with bestseller status?\n\nWe created this dataset to begin to answer some of these questions. Our first peer-reviewed essay based on insights gleaned from this data was published in December 2024. We plan to use our data in subsequent studies to look further into how international publication networks, country of origin, and author nationality and gender relate to a novel’s success as an international bestseller.\n\n\nDataset Description\n\ndate\nThe year and month the bestseller list was published by Publishing Trends or, for the U.S., the first week of the month in NYT Hardcover Fiction Bestsellers. Reflects aggregation date, not necessarily peak sales.\ncountry\nThe country where the bestseller list originates, as reported by Publishing Trends or NYT. France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the U.S. have the most consistent coverage; other countries are included periodically.\nrank\nThe title’s position on the bestseller list for that month and country (1 = highest selling, 10 = lowest).\ntitle\nThe title of the work as listed in the source. Uses the English-language translation where available; otherwise, the most apt translation or reported title from Publishing Trends. Titles are standardized across all entries for the same work.\nauthor\nThe author(s) of the work as listed in the original source. Multiple authors are separated by a semicolon (;). Pseudonyms are recorded as given.\nnationality\nThe country or countries of legal citizenship for the author(s), based on self-attribution or reputable sources. Dual citizenship is separated by a comma (,); multiple authors by a semicolon (;).\ngender\nThe gender identity of the author(s), attributed by the author or reputable sources. Uses m for man, w for woman, and n for nonbinary. Multiple authors/genders separated by a semicolon (;).\npublisher\nThe name of the original publisher of the title, based on available research and sources. For self-published works, the corporate entity/platform is listed (e.g., Amazon KDP, Wattpad).\npublisherCountry\nThe country where the original publisher is headquartered. This may reflect the national HQ of a multinational publisher or the country of a self-publishing platform. Determined by mapping publishers to countries, with manual correction when necessary.\n\n\nSpecial values and conventions:\n\nNaN: Indicates missing or unavailable information in any field.\n\nMultiple authors/values: Distinct values (authors, nationalities, genders) are separated by a semicolon (;). Shared values (e.g., dual citizenship for one author) are separated by a comma (,).\n\n\n\nCollection & Creation\nOur dataset contains entries for June 2013 through December 2022. Each month includes a ranked list of the top ten international bestsellers for each country as reported by Publishing Trends. For data on France, Italy, Spain, and Germany, we acquired bestseller lists from Publishing Trends (PT), a monthly newsletter published by Market Partners International, a New York based consulting firm. In consultation with Nina Sabak of PT, who edited the column on international bestsellers during the time of our collection, we scraped the site with OCR techniques as well as by hand. Minor gaps in the data are because the online column skips a few months throughout 2013-2022, and thus data did not exist for these months.\nFrom Publishing Trends, we gleaned what became columns for “Date,” “Country,” “Rank,” “Title,” and “Author.” We will walk through what these categories represent and how we determined entries for each. “Date” is the date—year and month—that the bestseller list was published by Publishing Trends. PT aggregates bestseller lists from multiple sources, reporting on bestsellers as given by each source at the time the report is generated. In most instances, booksellers update bestseller lists weekly, so the PT reports represent a snapshot of the month’s bestsellers. We describe our data as “monthly” in the sense that the lists have been aggregated by PT on a monthly basis. “Country” is the country where the bestseller list originates. The protocol at PT is to include Spain, France, Germany, and Italy each month, along with two other countries that are not consistent from month to month. Therefore, the number of entries for Italy, Spain, France, and Germany are roughly the same (1,140 entries each; 1,130 for France). However, the number of entries for the other 40 countries are not, with a range from 100 entries (Brazil) to 10 (Nigeria, Malta, and Iceland). “Rank” is the title’s rank on the bestseller list from 1 to 10. “Author” is the title’s author as listed in the original data source. We sometimes adjusted “Title” from its listing in PT. PT reports titles in English. As a rule, the site gives the title as the English-language translation if one exists. If there is no English-language translation, the site offers its own. The site’s own translations can vary for the same book from month-to-month; sometimes a book that wasn’t translated is later translated and then listed under its published English-language title. We have made such variations uniform, selecting a single title for all instances. Where a published English-language title exists, we use that. Where not, we have chosen that which we judged most apt from the versions on Publishing Trends.\nWe supplemented data from Publishing Trends with data on US bestsellers, which we drew from Jordan Pruett’s “NYT Hardcover Fiction Bestsellers” as published in the Post45 Data Collective. Because Pruett’s data is weekly, and to align US data with the monthly reporting schedule of PT described above, we used NYT data from the first week of each month. We use Pruett’s data for “Date,” “Country,” “Rank,” “Title,” and “Author” on all bestsellers in the United States.\nWe supplemented Publishing Trends and “NYT Hardcover Fiction Bestsellers” with additional columns for “Nationality,” “Gender,” “publisherCountry,” and “Publisher.” “Nationality” contains the nationality of the author; this data was compiled by research assistant Stephen Altobelli. We determined author nationality by self-attribution or attribution by a reputable source, such as the author’s publisher or a reputable publication such as the New York Times or Publishers Weekly. If the author was born in one country but lives in another, we determined their country of legal citizenship; in cases of dual citizenship, we list both countries; if we could not identify an author’s citizenship, we list the country of residence at the time of compilation. Throughout the dataset, a semicolon (;) separates distinct values, such as when a title has more than one author, each of whom are linked to their own nationality and gender. Alternately, a comma (,) separates values shared by an entity (usually, authors with dual citizenship). This difference also highlights a significant number of pseudonyms in which multiple authors work under a single name and may contain multiple nationality or gender data points. For example, see Carmen Mola (Spain), Iny Lorentz (Germany), Christina Lauren (U.S.), Helena S. Paige (South Africa), and Sveva Casati Matignani (Italy).\n“Gender” contains the gender of the author; this data was also compiled by Stephen Altobelli. We use “m” for man, “w” for woman, and “n” for nonbinary. We determined author gender by self-attribution or attribution by a reputable source, such as the author’s publisher or a reputable publication such as the New York Times or Publishers Weekly.\n“Publisher” contains the original publisher of the title and “publisherCountry” contains the original country of publication (based on primary national headquarters of publisher). Publishing Trends includes the publisher in the country where the title is a bestseller and the US publisher if the title has one. We found that when the author’s nationality matches the country where the title was a bestseller (e.g., Andrea Camilleri, Italy), the listed publisher was almost always the original publisher. We also found that when the author’s nationality is US and a US publisher is listed, the US publisher is almost always the original publisher. Given the limits on our time and our inability to hand annotate the complete dataset, we applied these as two rules. We then sampled 300 instances and checked by hand, finding greater than 90% accuracy. Where we found errors we fixed them. This means there is error in the dataset, but at a level we deemed acceptable. To determine “publisherCountry,” we created a dictionary mapping publishers to countries of publication and inferred the latter wherever we had the former.\nThe remaining titles—those for which author nationality did not match the country where the title was a bestseller or where the author was not from the US with a listed US publisher—we turned, first, to WorldCat’s data on year of publication for all formats and editions. In most cases, we were able to determine the original publisher/country of publication. If the earliest WorldCat entry appeared suspicious (e.g., listed a year far earlier than any other for the title) or if the title was published by more than one publisher in its initial year, we searched for corroborating evidence with literary agents, publishers, and booksellers. The results of this process present several areas that were consistently addressed within the dataset but require some explanation:\n1) In some cases, titles published simultaneously in multiple countries, especially in the English-speaking world, did not present an obvious original publisher. If additional research did not resolve the issue, we defaulted to the author’s native country.\n2) Occasionally, our research determined that an author published with a multinational publisher headquartered in one country, even though the publisher oversees an imprint or subsidiary in the author’s native country. For example, if an Argentinian author publishes with Planeta, the country of publication is Spain; likewise an Australian author who publishes with Pan Macmillan is listed as first published in the UK. This is especially common in countries that were previous territories of another country. Thus the legacy of colonialism is present in the data, due to so-called “commonwealth rights,” in which publishers automatically retain market rights in previous territories. However, if we found evidence that the author first contracted with the native subsidiary, we listed the publisher along with the name of the country (e.g., Pan Macmillan Australia). It’s worth noting that this is more common in the Anglosphere, such as with Australia and Canada, than with the Hispanosphere.\n3) At the same time, the ever-increasing centrality of the US disrupts these trends, as noted by the numerous UK authors who choose to publish select titles originally with a US publisher, including literary celebrities such as J.K. Rowling, Neil Gaiman, and Jojo Moyes. These instances required individual research, thus some degree of error may remain in this category, as we’ve corrected the most notable exceptions.\n4) Finally, for self-published titles we made the decision to attribute publisherCountry to the country of the corporate entity or platform used by the author. For example, in our dataset the country of publication for titles published through Wattpad is Canada; for Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing, the United States; for The Writers’ Coffee Shop, Australia; etc. This decision is consistent with our attention to the institutions of publication, rather than author nationality, in determining the country of publication.\nRegarding genre, while the dataset is generally limited to adult fiction, titles representative of other industry categories such as nonfiction, children’s literature, anime, and young adult literature occasionally show up on international lists, due to the variances in how foreign booksellers market, label, and list bestsellers. In a single instance (Hong Kong 07-2013), we removed a list generated by Publishing Trends from our dataset because it was entirely composed of nonfiction titles, thus making it inconsistent with the rest of the corpus.\nIn rare instances, mostly due to self-published authors using online handles, we could not identify personal data. In these cases, “NaN” signifies no available data. In one instance, the data is missing from the original source (Spain 2016-09, rank 10).\n\n\nEthical Considerations\nAuthor gender and nationality data could be considered sensitive, especially in the case where a particular author is using a pseudonym to mask one of these identifiers. However, all our data derives from publicly available information and is, therefore, not confidential.\n\n\nVersioning\nWe had intended to update the dataset annually using the same methodology described here. In 2023, Nina Sabak left Publishing Trends, and in September, the international bestseller section of the periodical was paused with no indication of being resumed. Without a consistent data source, expanding the dataset may be impossible, but we are working to identify possible solutions.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@article{dileonardi2025,\n  author = {DiLeonardi, Sean and Cohen, Becca and Sinykin, Dan},\n  editor = {Manshel, Alexander and Porter, J.D. and Walsh, Melanie},\n  title = {International {Bestsellers:} {The} {Dataset}},\n  journal = {Post45 Data Collective},\n  date = {2025-07-03},\n  url = {https://data.post45.org/posts/international-bestsellers/},\n  doi = {10.18737/IBDATA2025},\n  langid = {en},\n  abstract = {The “International Bestsellers” dataset draws attention to\n    how globalization has affected the publishing industry in the first\n    decades of the twenty-first century.
